            <h3>What if we live in a Multiverse?</h3>
            <p>Now this is a question, I have always wondered about? At early stage of my learning, I never got any answer for this concept, so I started researching, and this is what I concluded.

                The Universe we live in may not be the only one out there. In fact, our Universe could be just one of an infinite number of Universes making up a Multiverse. Well, there are some reasons that will make you think about it.
                
                
                Infinite Universe, Space-Time may stretch out to infinity. If so, then everything in our Universe is bound to repeat at some point, creating a patchwork quilt of infinite Universes.
                
                Bubble Universes, Eternal inflation theory suggest that some pockets of space stop inflating, while other regions continue to inflate, thus giving rise to many isolated Bubble Universes.
                
                Parallel Universes, according to this theory our Universe is one of potentially numerous 'slabs' floating in a higher-dimensional space.
                
                Daughter Universe, your every choice creates a new Universe, this theory arises from Quantum Mechanics. For example, when you toss a coin, Universe splits in two different daughter universes, which will continue with two different realties.
                
                Mathematical Universe, some Physicists believe that mathematics is not a only tool for describing the Universe but mathematics itself is the fundamental reality, and our observations of the Universe are just imperfect perceptions of its true mathematical nature.
                
                
                This would be incredible, if we could be living the Multiverse, isn't it?</p>
